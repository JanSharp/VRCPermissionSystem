- [x] Add build time ordering to permission definitions
- [x] Add ShowObjectByPermission
  - [x] Support instantiation
- [x] Add PermissionResolverInstantiationHelper
  - list of resolvers
  - inspector button to find all resolvers in children
  - on `Start`, as well as an `InitializeInstantiated` api function, call `InitializeInstantiated` on every resolver in the list
- [ ] Probably add ShowObjectsByPermission, very very similar to ShowObjectByPermission but affecting a list of game objects
- [x] ~~Add CustomPermissionResolver~~ Derive from the PermissionResolver class
  - [x] ~~Support instantiation? Maybe that's up to the deriving class~~ Deal with it yourself, unfortunately
- [ ] Add ShowIfAnyChildrenAreShown
- [x] Move logic back out of OnInitFinished and add its own isInitialized flag to the permission manager
- [ ] When there are no permission definitions in the scene yet and the editor script is creating one for the first time, make a new root object called "Permissions" and put the permission definition in there
- [ ] probably add a game state safe resolve function specifically for imports
- [ ] add invert to each element in the conditions list
